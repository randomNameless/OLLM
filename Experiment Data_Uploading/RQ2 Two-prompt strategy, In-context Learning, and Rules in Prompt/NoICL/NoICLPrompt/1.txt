Question and Task:

You will read an Android app sequence, containing actions to reach each page and the text on each page. Then I will send you a screenshot of the last page. Your task is to determine whether there is a UI error in the screenshot, if there is anything that does not correspond to the text on the page, or if there is a potential discrepancy. 
While you read the flow and answer questions, please read the rules below very carefully and consider them when you provide answers. 

Rulesï¼š

If you detect error messages, please also check the consistency or correctness of these elements about the provided sequence.
If you observe redundant or duplicate elements, it counts as a UI error.
If you observe part of the text, or sentences that are cut off, it means complete statements are truncated. It counts as a UI error.
Ignore system time and status bar Information and do not analyze. You should focus only on the information for the app itself.
If the screen is rotated, analyze the text accordingly.

Output Format:

Provide your answer with yes or no. 
If your answer is yes, please also provide the reason. The reason should be brief and concise. 
If you didn't detect any error, please answer 'No'. Finally, provide your final decision.
