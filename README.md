5) Get the emulator device number, in linux cmd run ’adb devices’, replace the number in d = Device("emulator-5554") in the 2nd code block with the device number of your own

6) Install apk and drag apk into the emulator. Open the app in your emulator

7) Go back to vscode, open the terminal, run code: sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-pkg-resources, pip install setuptools, python3 -m editor
