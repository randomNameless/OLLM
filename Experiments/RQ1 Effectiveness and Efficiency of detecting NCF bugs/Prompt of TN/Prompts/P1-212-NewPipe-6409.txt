You will read an app flow, containing page text and actions to reach other pages. Then I will ask you: Is there any logical error, or a bug in the output after the given test sequence?
While you read the flow and answer questions, please read the rules below very carefully and consider them when you provide answers. 
A logic error means the app didnâ€™t provide the expected result after performing actions. While evaluating logic errors, you should also consider the rules below:
You should not analyze battery, system time and signal fluctuates in page content and coordinate in actions. This means if you see changes in time, signal, or battery, you should not consider them logic errors or inconsistencies. You should not consider them as input. And your answer should be no.
You should focus only on analyzing the logic flow without making any feedback or expected behavior predictions. 
You should not analyze duplicated UI elements. 
You should not analyze the lack of confirmation messages. 
You should not analyze unchanged output structure. 
The rules are irrelevant to the logic flow.
Provide your answer with yes or no. 
If your answer is yes, please also provide the reason. The reason should be brief and concise. If you didn't detect any error, please answer no. Finally, provide your final decision.
