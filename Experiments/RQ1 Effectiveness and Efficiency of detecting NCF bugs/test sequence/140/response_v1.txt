Reason: After entering "messi2.jpg" in the search and pressing enter, the output structure still lists "messi.jpg" as part of the search results of "messi2.jpg". This indicates a logical error or inconsistency in the search function's output, as it should only display the results relevant to the latest search query, unless the search is designed to include partial matches or related files, which is not specified.
