Yes
Reason: After hiding "messi.jpg" and then attempting to unhide it (indicated by the user's interaction with "Hidden Files" and "Delete Bookmark"), the final output does not show "messi.jpg" returning to the visible files list. This suggests a logical error in either the hiding/unhiding mechanism or in the UI update process to reflect the current state of file visibility.
