Yes: After renaming "tag2" to "tag2tag1", the output structure shows "text: tag1", "text: 2" indicating there are two instances of "tag1", but later, when viewing the note details, it displays "text: tag1", "text: tag1" as if there are two separate tags with the same name, which contradicts the expected consolidation of tags under the renamed "tag2tag1" into a single "tag1" entry. This inconsistency suggests a logical error in how tag renaming and aggregation are handled or displayed.
