Yes: The logical error is that the file name "messi 19 99.jpg" is shown with URL encoding (%20 for spaces) as "messi%2019%2099.jpg" in the final output structure. This suggests a display inconsistency, as file names in a file manager app should be shown as they were input, without URL encoding in the user interface.
