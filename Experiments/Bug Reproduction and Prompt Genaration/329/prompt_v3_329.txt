Prompt v3:
click Site Pages
click org.wordpress.android:id/newPageButton
input org.wordpress.android:id/title Title of third page
input org.wordpress.android:id/aztec My story
click Navigate up
click DRAFTS
click Title of third page
click SAVE

Final output structure:

    Clickable Buttons: ['text: KEEP EDITING', 'text: PUBLISH NOW']
    Other Buttons: ['text: 10:58', 'content-desc: Android Setup notification: Finish setting up your sdk_gphone_x86', 'content-desc: Airplane mode.', 'content-desc: Battery 100 percent.', 'text: Ready to Publish?', 'text: This page will be published immediately.']
Above is an app flow, containing the last page text and the actions from the first page to reach other pages.

These are the rules for evaluating the test sequence and the output structure. This means if you notice following, you should not consider them logic errors or inconsistencies.

1. You should not analyze battery, time and signal fluctuates in page content and coordinate in actions. 
2. You should focus only on analyzing the logic flow.
3. You should ignroe duplicated UI elements. 
4. You should not analyze the lack of confirmation messages. 
5. You should not analyze unchanged output structure. 
6. You should ignore changes in categories of UI elements.



My question: Is there any inconsistency, a discrepancy, a logical error, a bug in the output after the given test sequence?
