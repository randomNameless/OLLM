Yes
Reason: There is an inconsistency in the expected functionality versus the described output. After selecting an image and clicking "Confirm," the text in the editor changes to a placeholder symbol 'ï¿¼', which doesn't directly indicate that an image has been inserted, especially in a text-based description. Additionally, the final step to "Preview" shows the actual HTML img tag with a source URL, which might not be expected behavior from a user's perspective without seeing an intermediate step showing the image is successfully added to the post content in the editor interface. This could be confusing or considered a discrepancy in how media insertion feedback is provided to the user within the app flow.
