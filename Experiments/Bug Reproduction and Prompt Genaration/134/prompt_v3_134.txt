These are the rules for evaluating the test sequence and the output structure. This means if you notice following, you should not consider them logic errors or inconsistencies.

1. You should not analyze battery, time and signal fluctuates in page content and coordinate in actions. 
2. You should focus only on analyzing the logic flow.
3. You should ignroe duplicated UI elements. 
4. You should not analyze the lack of confirmation messages. 
5. You should not analyze unchanged output structure. 
6. You should ignore changes in categories of UI elements.
