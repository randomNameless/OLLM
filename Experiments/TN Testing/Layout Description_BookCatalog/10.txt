This dialog, within a FrameLayout, features a LinearLayout at the top with the title "Add Book...".

The action "Restart" implies a functionality but lacks context in the XML layout provided.
The option "Add Book", located at (542, 852), is a short click action item. This likely initiates the process of adding a book manually.
The option "Add by Name", located at (542, 1358), also designed for a short click, suggests a feature to add books by entering their names.
