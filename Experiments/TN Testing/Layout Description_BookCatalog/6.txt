This XML layout describes the main interface of the "Book Catalogue" app in Android. The page contains a title bar at the top, displaying the app's name. Below the title bar, there's a section indicating the current bookshelf ("Bookshelf:") and its name ("Default"), alongside a counter showing the number of books (0) and an interactive element to expand or collapse the bookshelf list. The main content area provides a message indicating that there are no books in the selected bookshelf and prompts the user to add books via a menu at the bottom of the screen.

Regarding the 'neighbors' sections:

Neighbor "5": A TextView with resource ID com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue:id/bookshelf_num, positioned at (582, 171), can be short-clicked. This widget displays the number of books in the current bookshelf (text "(0)").
Neighbors "7", "6", "15", "16", "8", "10", "20", "32": These neighbors all mention an action "Menu", but without specific resource IDs or further details, the exact elements related to this action cannot be determined.
Neighbor "9": The action "Restart" is mentioned, but without associated XML elements, the exact interaction or widget cannot be identified.
Neighbor "18": Includes two actions: "Menu" and a short click on the widget with resource ID com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue:id/bookshelf_name, located at (418, 170). This widget likely represents the spinner for selecting a bookshelf.
